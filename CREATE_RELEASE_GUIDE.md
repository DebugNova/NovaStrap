- ✅ Allows users to directly download the .exe file
- ✅ Doesn't show code when clicking download
- ✅ Tracks version history
- ✅ Looks professional

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "File too large" error
- GitHub allows files up to 100 MB
- NovaStrap.exe is 35 MB, so it should work fine
- If you get this error, let me know!

### Release not showing
- Make sure you clicked "Publish release" (not "Save draft")
- Refresh the page
- Check: https://github.com/DebugNova/NovaStrap/releases

### Download still shows code
- Make sure you clicked **NovaStrap.exe** in the Assets section
- NOT the "Source code" links
- Users should click the .exe file with the file size shown

---

## 🚀 You're Ready!

Once you create the release:
1. The README download link will work
2. Users can directly download NovaStrap.exe
3. No more code showing when clicking download!

**This is the professional way to distribute apps on GitHub!** 🎉
