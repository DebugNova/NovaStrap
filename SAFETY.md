## ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Defender Warning

### "Windows protected your PC"

You might see this warning when running NovaStrap.exe:

```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
```

**This is a FALSE POSITIVE.** Here's why:

### Why This Happens
1. **PyInstaller apps** are often flagged by antivirus (common issue)
2. **New files** without digital signatures trigger warnings
3. **Windows SmartScreen** blocks apps from unknown publishers
4. **NovaStrap is new** - not yet recognized by Microsoft

### How to Run It Safely

**Option 1: Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"**
```
1. Click "More info" on the warning
2. Click "Run anyway" button
3. NovaStrap will open normally
```

**Option 2: Add to Exclusions**
```
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
3. Click "Manage settings"
4. Scroll to "Exclusions"
5. Add NovaStrap.exe
```

**Option 3: Build It Yourself**
```
If you're still worried, build from source:
1. Download the source code
2. Run: python main.py
3. Or build: pyinstaller NovaStrap.spec
```
